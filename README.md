- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarajaved797.  I am a  new newbie to data science from the accounting field. 
- 👀 I’m interested in data science/machine learning
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  the foundations of datascience/Machine Learing-- including Python, Numpy,Pandas, statistics, ML algorithms.
- - 💞️ I’m working towards to be able to create atleast in the start some simple projects to have a strong foundation. 
- Data science is a fascinating field, so much to learn and explore. It is hard to keep up with new advancemnents but I will keep trying.
-
- Datascience is a challenging but  an equally motivating field as you get to see the results of your learning right away.
  
-I think it would not be wrong to say that datascientists are the modern day prophets---they are predicting using various tools.
Accountants look toward the past--datascientists predict the future.

 -Enough about me, better get back to studying.
